## ✅ Concise Checklist  

- **Analyze** the existing project to locate all {{ before }}‑specific artifacts (dependencies, config files, annotations, and API usages).  
- **Translate** dependencies and configuration files from {{ before }} to {{ after }}.  
- **Refactor** source code to replace {{ before }} APIs with their {{ after }} equivalents, preserving functionality.  
- **Update** build scripts (e.g., Maven/Gradle) and plugin declarations to target {{ after }}.  
- **Compile** the migrated project, and self‑correct any failures.  
- **Log** every migration step, validation result, and error in `CHANGELOG.md` with timestamps and severity levels.

## 🖥️ Execution Environment  

- The agent runs in a **Linux‑based shell**.  
- The entire Java application source tree is present in the **current working directory** (the application root).  
- **No files or directories outside this root** may be created, modified, or deleted.  

---

## 🔄 Migration Workflow  

1. **Migrate dependencies & configuration** for the target framework (`{{ after }}`).  
2. **Refactor primary application code** to ensure compatibility with {{ after }}.  
3. **Update build scripts/files** (pom.xml, build.gradle, etc.) as required.  
4. **Attempt compilation** to confirm successful migration. Because you will only have write access to the working directory, use `mvn -q -Dmaven.repo.local=.m2repo clean package` or `./gradlew -g .gradle clean build` as your compilation command.
5. **Record** all actions, validations, and any errors in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 📄 Required Output (single Markdown report)  

The agent must **produce one‑shot** output containing the following sections:

### 1. Migration Summary  
A concise description of the migration activities, stating that the project was moved from `{{ before }}` to `{{ after }}`.

### 2. File Tree (modified/added/removed files)  
A hierarchical list of all files that were changed, created, or deleted, with a brief explanation of each modification.

### 3. Step‑by‑Step Log  
Entries formatted as:

```
[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] [severity] Action description – Result
```

where **severity** is one of `info`, `warning`, or `error`. Each entry must include the outcome of any validation performed after the step.

### 4. CHANGELOG.md Contents  
Display the complete contents of `CHANGELOG.md` inside a fenced markdown code block (````markdown`). The changelog must contain every logged entry from the Step‑by‑Step Log, plus any additional diagnostic details required for errors.

### 5. Error Handling  
For any compilation or runtime failures:
- Provide a detailed description of the error (including file/line if applicable).  
- Indicate severity.  
- Suggest corrective actions or indicate that the agent attempted an automatic fix and the result of that attempt.

## 📌 Important Constraints  

- **One‑Shot Execution:** The agent must complete the entire migration after receiving this prompt; no further prompts or confirmations are allowed.  
- The final project **must compile**.  
- All **error handling** (compilation errors, etc.) must be documented in `CHANGELOG.md` with timestamps, severity, and suggested mitigations.  
- If a step fails, the agent must **log the failure**, attempt an **automatic correction**, re‑validate, and only proceed when the step succeeds or is logged as an unrecoverable error.
