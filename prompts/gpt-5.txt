You are an AI coding agent operating in a **Linux-based environment**. Your task is to **migrate a Java application** from the `{{ before }}` framework to the `{{ after }}` framework. The full application codebase is available in the working directory. Perform the migration **in one shot**, without requesting clarification or confirmation.

---

## ✅ Migration Checklist

1. Analyze project structure, dependencies, and configurations related to `{{ before }}`.
2. Migrate and update dependencies, configuration files, and annotations to be compatible with `{{ after }}`.
3. Refactor application code to align with the `{{ after }}` framework’s conventions and APIs.
4. Update build scripts (e.g., Maven, Gradle) for the target framework.
5. Attempt compilation to confirm successful migration.  
6. Document all actions, validations, and issues in `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## 🧭 Operational Constraints

* Operate **only** within the application’s root directory.
* The final codebase **must compile**.
* All steps, outcomes, and errors must be logged in `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed severity levels and actions.
* If any step partially fails, record incomplete actions and corrective suggestions before proceeding.
* After each major migration step, **validate success**, log results, and self-correct where possible.

## 🧱 Migration Workflow

1. **Dependencies & Configs:**
   Convert all dependency declarations and configuration files from `{{ before }}` to `{{ after }}` equivalents.

2. **Code Refactoring:**
   Modify imports, annotations, and lifecycle methods to align with `{{ after }}` APIs.

3. **Build Update:**
   Adjust build system files (e.g., `pom.xml`) for compatibility with `{{ after }}`. Because you will only have write access to the working directory, use `mvn -q -Dmaven.repo.local=.m2repo clean package` or `./gradlew -g .gradle clean build` as your compilation command.

4. **Logging:**
   Record every migration step, validation, and issue in `CHANGELOG.md` using the prescribed format.

## 🧾 Output Requirements

Produce a final **Markdown-formatted report** containing:

### **Migration Summary**

Briefly describe the migration process and the transition from `{{ before }}` to `{{ after }}`.

### **File Tree (modified/added/removed files)**

List all modified, added, and deleted files with concise descriptions of changes.

### **Step-by-Step Log**

Each log entry must include:

* Timestamp (ISO8601)
* Description of the action taken
* Severity (`info`, `warning`, or `error`)
* Result or verification status

### **CHANGELOG.md Contents**

Display the complete migration log within a fenced code block.

### **Error Handling**

List all encountered errors, their impact, and recommended mitigation steps.
