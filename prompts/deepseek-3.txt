**Task:** Migrate the Java application from `{{ before }}` to `{{ after }}` framework in one shot. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze and update dependencies/configurations for `{{ after }}`.
2. Refactor application code to be `{{ after }}`-compatible.
3. Adjust build files and scripts.
4. Attempt compilation to confirm successful migration. Because you will only have write access to the working directory, use `mvn -q -Dmaven.repo.local=.m2repo clean package` or `./gradlew -g .gradle clean build` as your compilation command.
5. Document all steps in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Environment
- OS: Linux-based
- Scope: Application root directory only
- Constraints:
  - Ensure compilation
  - Self-correct and log failures

## Execution Rules
- Proceed without confirmation
- Log all actions with timestamps and severity
- Validate after each major step
- Record errors with mitigation steps

## Expected Output Structure
